iex> [ 'cat' | 'dog' ]
['cat',100,111,103]

iex> [[99, 97, 116] | [100, 111, 103]]
['cat', 100, 111, 103]

iex> ['dog'] ++ 'dog'
['dog', 100, 111, 103]

Result:
We get this result because we have the 'cat' element and are appending a list of codepoints into this.
While doing this we are leaving the 'cat' element untouched.

Another explanation could be, that when we are writing [ 'cat' | 'dog' ] we have [ head | tail ] and the tail is appended to the head, leaving the head untouched.
