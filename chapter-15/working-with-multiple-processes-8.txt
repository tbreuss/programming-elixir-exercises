Run the Fibonacci code on your machine. Do you get comparable timings? If your machine has multiple cores and/or processors, do you see improvements in the timing as we increase the applicationâ€™s concurrency?

Yes, I get comparable timings.

No, I don't see improvements by increasing the number of entries from 20 to 100.
Have to do some more tests.
