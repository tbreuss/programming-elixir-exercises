We now have three different implementations of FizzBuzz. 
One uses cond, one uses case, and one uses separate functions with guard clauses.
Take a minute to look at all three.

1) Which do you feel best expresses the problem? 

Both the case and the cond solution express the problem better because
the solution is shaped within one methode within a few lines of code.

2) Which will be easiest to maintain?

The Guards solution because the problem is divided into small chunks of code.
But more important, each of the methods is better testable and therefore maintainable.
